Royal Scheme will eventually grow to be a real, usable,
embeddable Scheme implemented in ANSI C.

A primary goal of Royal Scheme is documenting the
development of a real language implementation to show
that mortals can accomplish the task.

Thanks to Abdulaziz Ghuloum for his paper "An Incremental
Approach to Compiler Construction". The pedagogy of his
paper which inspired the incremental development of
Royal Scheme.

Thanks to Alex Shinn for making his Chibi-Scheme
implementation open source. Chibi-Scheme has inspired
much of the code in Royal Scheme.
